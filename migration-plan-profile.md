# Profile Page Migration Plan

## Current Status

The profile functionality has been migrated to adhere to the new folder structure:

1. New structure created:
   - Profile component at `src/app/routes/profile/page.tsx`

2. Redirects added:
   - Redirect from old location (`/app/profile`) to new location (`/routes/profile`)

3. Navigation components updated:
   - All navigation links now point to `/routes/profile`

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with the new profile path:
   - Verify that navigation links work correctly
   - Confirm that the profile page loads properly
   - Test that user information displays correctly

2. Verify that the redirect from the old location works properly

3. After confirming everything works, delete the old profile directory:
   ```
   rm -rf src/app/profile
   ```

## Implementation Details

- The profile component has been moved with minimal changes
- All references to the old profile path have been updated to the new location
- Login redirect updated to use the new `/routes/login` path instead of `/login`
