# Login Page Migration Plan

## Current Status

The login functionality has been migrated to adhere to the new folder structure:

1. New structure created:
   - Login component at `src/app/routes/login/page.tsx`
   - Authentication model at `src/app/models/auth/Login.ts`

2. Redirects added:
   - Redirect from old location (`/app/login`) to new location (`/routes/login`)

3. Navigation components updated:
   - All navigation links now point to `/routes/login`

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with the new login path:
   - Verify that navigation links work correctly
   - Confirm that the login page loads properly
   - Test login functionality with both email/password and Microsoft options

2. Verify that the redirect from the old location works properly

3. After confirming everything works, delete the old login directory:
   ```
   rm -rf src/app/login
   ```

## Implementation Details

- The login component has been moved with minimal changes
- A new `Login.ts` model file has been created for type definitions
- All references to the old login path have been updated to the new location
